# Instacart-Python
This is a Python Data Analysis Project for Instacart, a tech company that operates as a same-day-grocery-pick-up-and-delivery service in the U.S. and Canada.

# Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Data Set
The project uses a number of open-source sets from Instacart and a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of this project).
